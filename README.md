# Full Stack open (2023 - 2024)

My solutions for the exercises of the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/)'s [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course. This repository contains solutions from part 0 to part 9 of the course. Full stack open is an excellent introduction to modern web development. The core course consists of parts 0 to 5. After the core course, you can complete other parts in the order you want.

## Notes

- This repository is a monorepo that contains multiple applications under a shared workspace using **npm Workspaces**.
- All apps share a single `node_modules` directory at the root. Common dependencies are managed at the root, while each app maintains its own specific dependencies
- Run `npm install` at the root then navigate to the application which you want to run.
